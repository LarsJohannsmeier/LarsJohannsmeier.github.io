## Research Focus

My research centers on tactile robot manipulation and learning-based skill acquisition, with a strong emphasis on contact-rich control, autonomous policy synthesis, and transfer from controlled lab settings to robust industrial deployment; across roles in academia and industry, I connect representation learning, planning, and systems engineering to build robotic skills that are reliable under uncertainty and practical for real-world applications.
