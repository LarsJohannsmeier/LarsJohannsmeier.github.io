## Research Themes

### 1) Tactile Skill Learning
Developing representations and policies for contact-rich manipulation, with emphasis on transferability and robustness.

### 2) Autonomous Policy Synthesis
Combining process taxonomies, planning, and learning to automate policy generation for robotic skills.

### 3) Applied Industrial Robotics
Translating research into practical systems with measurable gains in performance, reliability, and deployment readiness.

## Current Direction

I am especially interested in methods that bridge foundational learning theory and system-level engineering constraints in real robotic platforms.
