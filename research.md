## Research Themes

### 1) Contact-Intensive Manipulation Learning
Learning architectures and models for tactile and contact-rich robotic skills.

### 2) Autonomous Policy Synthesis
Process-taxonomy-based planning and learning-driven policy generation for manipulation tasks.

### 3) Real-World Robotics Systems
From demonstrators to product transfer: robust implementation across control, planning, and software systems.

## Current Direction

My current work at NVIDIA focuses on robotics, AI, and machine learning, with an emphasis on
methods that scale from research prototypes to dependable real-world systems.
